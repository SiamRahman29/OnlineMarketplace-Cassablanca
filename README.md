<h1>Cassablanca: the Online Marketplace</h1>

<h2>General Info</h2>
Cassablanca is a typical online marketplace with all the basic features you might expect. You can see items and contact sellers as a customer. If you have an account,
you can add, remove, or edit items for sale. You can see messages what messages customers have sent you. It is also possible to search and filter products.

<h2>Technical Info</h2>
The project was built using Python and the Django framework. I used a virtual environment to build it. If you download the whole code, just cd into the OnlineMarketplace 
folder inside and you should be able to run it using python manage.py runserver.
